[Live Site](https://astro-uic-tutorial.netlify.app/)

A simple blog website made using Astro. Blog posts are categorized using tags and, using Astro components, are dynamically displayed and sorted. RSS feed supported.
With previous experience in React and JavaScript, most of the code was easy to understand. One of the more difficult concepts was the tags and RSS, but I found it interesting and useful.

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
